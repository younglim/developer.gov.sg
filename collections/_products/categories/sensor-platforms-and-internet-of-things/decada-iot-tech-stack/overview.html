<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  IoT refers to the concept of numerous devices being connected to the Internet,
  allowing data about the physical world to be collected, analysed and used for
  decision-making. IoT has been adopted in many areas, from consumer-focused to
  industrial sectors, and the Government is no exception.
</p>
<p>
  DECADA (Device Management, Control and Data Acquisition Systems) was initially
  conceived as a centralized cloud platform for Government IoT systems. It has
  since been developed into more components, which together form the IoT Tech
  Stack.
</p>

<h2>What is the IoT Tech Stack?</h2>

<p>
  The IoT Tech Stack is a set of tools and services for sensors and IoT
  applications and is also known as DECADA. It consists of three core
  components, which facilitate the acquisition and exchange of data from sensors
  to the cloud. Agencies can use DECADA to easily develop and run IoT
  applications.
</p>
<p>The three core components of the IoT Tech Stack are as shown below.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a
      href="/products/categories/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/decada-embedded"
      target="_blank"
      >DECADA Embedded</a
    >
    (formerly known as MANUCA): This is a family of microcontroller-class
    devices that can communicate directly to DECADA Cloud. DECADA Embedded
    provides software reference designs for onboarding and communication with
    DECADA Cloud. Hence, developers can add custom application logic for their
    use cases and quickly have a ready-to-deploy embedded device.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="/products/categories/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/decada-edge-gateway"
      target="_blank"
      >DECADA Edge Gateway</a
    >: A product and software solution to onboard new and existing sensor nodes
    to DECADA easily and securely. It is both a <b>gateway</b> to DECADA Cloud,
    and an <b>edge device</b> to process and aggregate sensor nodes data to
    reduce data traffic to the cloud. Agencies can make use of its web user
    interface to allow for various combinations of sensor nodes connection and
    data processing.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a
      href="/products/categories/sensor-platforms-and-internet-of-things/decada-cloud"
      target="_blank"
      >DECADA Cloud</a
    >: A multi-tenant cloud platform deployed on the
    <a
      href="/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud"
      target="_blank"
      >Government Commercial Cloud</a
    >. DECADA Cloud’s features include asset management, data acquisition, event
    triggers, stream processing, data analytics, report generation and APIs for
    querying data.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Should the IoT Tech Stack be Adopted?</h2>

<p>
  As digital services become an integral part of everyday life, there is a need
  for these services to be easy to use, adaptable and relevant. This means that
  digital services must be technologically advanced and streamlined to meet the
  needs of today’s highly digitalised era.
</p>
<p>
  While most agencies develop their own services and infrastructure to cater to
  the needs of specific citizens or business groups that they serve, this may
  not be the most cost-friendly or time-efficient way.
</p>
<p>
  GovTech’s IoT Tech Stack allows agencies and developers to achieve the above
  by enabling quick and cost-efficient development and deployment of IoT-related
  applications, and easy exchange of data across the government. This aggregates
  data collection for richer insights that would in turn help develop policy and
  monitor operations.
</p>

<h2>How do You Use the IoT Tech Stack?</h2>

<p>
  GovTech provides an easy-to-use starter kit for software developers interested
  in making use of the IoT Tech Stack for their agencies. It is designed to get
  developers started with sending data from an embedded device, DECADA Embedded,
  to the government IoT cloud, DECADA Cloud. This kit was used in both the
  <a href="/communities/events/stack-x-conference" target="_blank"
    >STACK-X 2019</a
  >
  and
  <a href="/communities/events/stack-2020" target="_blank">STACK2020</a>
  conference workshops. To find out more about the DECADA Starter kit, click
  <a
    href="https://docs.developer.tech.gov.sg/docs/decada-starter-kit-guide/#/"
    target="_blank"
    >here</a
  >. Apart from the physical components, the starter kit also contains a
  walkthrough guide on how to get started.

<h2>Success Stories</h2>

<p>Notable use cases of DECADA include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      <a
        href="/products/categories/digital-solutions-to-address-covid-19/safeentry"
        target="_blank"
        >SafeEntry Gateway</a
      >
      prototypes were based off DECADA Embedded examples, which gave developers
      the speed to iterate the business logic, instead of handling cloud
      connection logic. It pushes token data to DECADA Cloud, and relies on
      integrations within DECADA Cloud with other GovTech services to ensure
      that up-to-date information is always available to enable smooth contact
      tracing efforts.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Smart Office solutions were implemented in a few Government agencies’
      offices, using DECADA Edge Gateway and Cloud. It allows easy configuration
      and control of lights, blinds, air-conditioning, and monitoring of meeting
      room usage status.

        >Personal Alert Buttons (PABs)</a
      >
      have been installed in more than 6,000 housing units from 53 rental flats
      in Singapore. DECADA is used to manage the button devices and route alerts
      to the relevant Senior Activity Centre (SAC) or telecare operator to
      handle the case.
