  - name: Is digital signing with Sign With Singpass secure?
    description: >
      Using signing certificates issued by the National Certification Authority, Assurity Trusted Solutions Pte. Ltd., Sign with Singpass produces digital signatures that are regarded as Secure Electronic Signatures (SES) under Singapore's Electronic Transactions Act.
      <br/>
      <br/>The digital signature is identifiable and cryptographically linked to the signer, providing higher assurance of the authenticity and integrity of the signed documents. This differs from electronic signatures generally, which may require additional supporting evidence and audit trails to prove their authenticity.
      <br/>The signed documents are also tamper-proof, such that if the electronic record is altered, the system will alert the user that the signature is invalid. Subsequent changes to the signed document are detectable and credentials are uniquely linked and identifiable to the signers.
