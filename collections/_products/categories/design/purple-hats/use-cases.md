### Example 1

A screen reader user provides feedback that they are not able to understand and navigate across the different website pages because all the navigational buttons read out as "Buttons".

**How Purple HATS can help:**

- Purple HATS can scan through the entire website to identify and provide a report on its accessibility-related code issues
- Using the report, developers will be able to quickly pick out similar code issues related to the feedback and refer to the WCAG clause which provides more information and possible solutions
- If the affected code is part of a component, fixing it at the component level may improve the accessibility across all other pages that uses the component
- The other accessibility issues in the report can also be used to plan the team’s accessibility roadmap.
