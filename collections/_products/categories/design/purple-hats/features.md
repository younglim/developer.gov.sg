### Automated testing tool based on axe-core

Purple HATS runs a bot that can identify areas for accessibility improvement by identifying potential accessibility issues on a webpage. The bot then provides the impact of the identified accessibility issues using the axe-core library of the AXE accessibility testing engine from Deque Systems.

###  Choice of sitemap or website scans

Users can choose either scanning modes to achieve comprehensive coverage of your website.

### Identification of accessibility issues based on WCAG 2.1 specifications

Purple HATS identifies accessibility issues using the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/){:target="\_blank"} specifications. The WCAG 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making web content more accessible.

### Integration into CI/CD pipeline with single command-line 

Teams can rapidly scan and check for potential accessibility issues from their development machines or within the CI/CD pipeline with basic command-line knowledge.

### Accessibility Reports in JSON and HTML formats 

The report identifies potential accessibility issues with:

- A description
- A link to the relevant Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) clause (an internationally recognized source for accessibility policies)
- The HTML code snippet of the affected page
- A help link to Deque University, an online digital accessibility resource from Deque Systems, for users to learn more about the issue.
