With the new data classification and sensitivity support, users can now access Vault datasets containing up to Confidential (Cloud-Eligible), Sensitive High data from AG@GCC.

### AG@GCC: Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)

In the second half of 2023, AG@GCC will bring in new cloud services to support MLOps capabilities, starting with Amazon SageMaker Studio, so that agencies can efficiently develop and deploy ML models at scale in the future. Note that Analytics.gov, as a central WOG platform, will also explore MLOps services from other Cloud Service Providers.
