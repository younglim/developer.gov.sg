### Multipurpose one-stop utility

SupplyAlly can be used for a variety of distribution purposes. As a one-stop solution that connects to multiple environments for different policies and distribution initiatives, SupplyAlly eliminates logistical issues. Items distributed to beneficiaries are also trackable.

### Quick processing

The app’s lightweight build and minimal integrations allow it to process transactions with great speed – up to 4,500 transactions per second, with a 50-millisecond response latency. This ensures quick processing during the distribution exercises.

### Configurable for different redemption methods

With SupplyAlly in use, eligible individuals can collect items on behalf of their household as well. 

### Speedy and secure app registration for distribution volunteers

SupplyAlly does not require volunteers to sign up with personal details. Instead, volunteers are issued a QR code to be scanned using the app on their devices. After which, they are authorised to use the app with no further details required. The QR codes are permanently affiliated with the user’s device, meaning that they cannot be used for unauthorised logins even if someone else obtains them.

### Secured transactions with data privacy

Volunteers can scan the identity cards of residents to verify their eligibility and log the transaction. No personally identifiable information is stored, except for a time-stamped digital signature that prevents the same identity card from being used for a duplicate collection.
