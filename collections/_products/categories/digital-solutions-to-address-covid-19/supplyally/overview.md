Since 2020, SupplyAlly has been the centralised distribution system for WOG and organisations to issue items that improve the lives of Singaporeans.

The COVID-19 pandemic produced an urgent need to address logistical challenges on a national scale. During the onset of the pandemic, the distribution of reusable face masks to all Singapore residents created a logistical challenge to track collection quotas and manage a flexible pool of volunteers.

Automating logistic distributions prevents wastage of resources that can occur because of a lapse in the distribution system. This prevents duplicate distributions and optimises volunteersâ€™ efforts. SupplyAlly provides convenience to citizens while maintaining operational flexibility to different points and modes of distribution.
