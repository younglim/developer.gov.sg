<h3>Building your Zero-knowledge Proof (ZKP) circuit</h3>

<p>
  In this post, we’ll be showing you how to build your own ZKP circuit from
  scratch. But before that, we have to decide which language we want to use.
</p>
<p>
  If you ask around right now, you’ll find that your two main options are
  ZoKrates and Circom. We’ll be focusing on using ZoKrates today, but for your
  knowledge, here’s a quick breakdown of each language and their features:
</p>
<p><u>ZoKrates:</u></p>
<p>
  <strong>High level ZKP library</strong> – you don’t need to know too much
  about the inner workings of a circuit to use it
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Gentler learning curve</strong> – this is the easier language to pick
  up of the two if you’re a newcomer
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Better tutorial</strong> – more user-friendly and understandable, with
  working examples within the tutorial
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Tailored for blockchain use</strong> – ZoKrates was made to be used
  with blockchains and doesn’t have a web sdk yet
</p>
<p><u>Circom:</u></p>
<p>
  <strong>Low level ZKP library</strong> – you’ll get to dive into the inner
  workings of circuits and write code similar to Verilog (if you’re familiar
  with this)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Steeper learning curve</strong> – this is definitely the harder
  language to pick up, since it’s more declarative than functional
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Absence of tutorial</strong> –&nbsp;you have to learn via the various
  implementations and tests within the code
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Not tied to blockchains</strong> – unlike ZoKrates, you’ll be able to
  use this for a wider variety of purposes
</p>
<p>
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> – you can run tests in JavaScript, and Circom has
  a JavaScript Library for the development of web applications
</p>
<p>
  From this breakdown, you can probably see why we’re opting to go with ZoKrates
  for an introductory tutorial.
</p>
<p>Now, let’s get to visualising our circuit…</p>

<h3>The task at hand</h3>

<p>Let’s first recall the aim of our circuit.</p>
<p>
  We were previously trying to show that ZKPs could help a shopper to prove that
  they’re above the legal age limit for purchasing alcohol
  <em>without </em>revealing their actual age.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  Let’s start simple. What exactly am I trying to prove with age restrictions?
  Let’s take the legal age to be 21 and let’s take <strong>X</strong> to be our
  age.
</p>
<p>You might therefore say that we’re trying to prove something like this:</p>
<p>
  ‘I know of a number, <strong>X</strong>, that is greater than
  <strong>21</strong>, but I won’t tell you what <strong>X</strong> is.’
</p>
<p>Here’s how that circuit would look like:</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20ZKP%20Circuit%201.png" alt="A basic age verification circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  Our circuit simply calculates if <strong>X </strong>is <strong>≥ 21</strong>.
  If it is, we get <strong>T</strong> and we’re granted permission to buy our
  beverage. This is, however, a little unsophisticated for our purposes. For
  instance, what if we want to apply this to a variety of products that might
  have different age restrictions?
</p>
<p>
  Let’s take a second pass at this without specifying the precise age limit.
  This time let’s take <strong>X</strong> to be our birth year.
</p>
<p>We could say we’re trying to prove that:</p>
<p>
  ‘I know of a number, <strong>X</strong>, such that <strong>Y - X ≥ Z</strong>,
  where <strong>Y</strong> is the current year and <strong>Z</strong> is the age
  restriction. I won’t tell you what <strong>X </strong>is, but
  <strong>Y</strong> and <strong>Z </strong>are public knowledge.’
</p>
<p>Again, here’s what that would look like:</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20ZKP%20Circuit%202.png" alt="Age check circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  The circuit deducts our birth year from the current year to derive our age.
  From there, we compare our age with the legal age restriction,
  <strong>Z</strong>—if it’s <strong>≥ Z</strong>, we get <strong>T</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This is a little better, but if you remember from <a
    href="/communities/stack-x-meetups/past-webinars/zero-knowledge-proof-part-1"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >Part 1</a
  >, we wanted our
  circuit to include three <strong>public</strong> <strong>inputs</strong>.
  <strong>Y </strong>and <strong>X </strong>are public inputs, but we’re also
  missing something else: we’ll want to include information from an external
  source (say, a public national database, a smartcard, etc.) that can verify
  the claim that we are indeed born in the year <strong>X</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  This brings us to attempt three. We’ll say that we’re trying to prove that:
</p>
<p>
  ‘I know of a number, <strong>X</strong>, such that <strong>F(X) = a</strong>,
  where <strong>a</strong> has been attested by the Government to be a valid
  piece of evidence about my age. I won’t tell you what <strong>X</strong> is,
  but you can verify<strong> a</strong>.’
</p>
<p>Let’s have a look.</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20ZKP%20Circuit%203.png" alt="Full ZKP circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  Remember hashing? When we talk about <strong>F(X)</strong> here, we’re really
  referring to the hashed output of <strong>X</strong>, or
  <strong>H(X +S)</strong> in the diagram. Our hashed <strong>X</strong> should
  match our hashed birth year, <strong>a</strong>, which uses the same inputs.
  This is how the cashier verifies that the birth year we provided is real.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Side</strong>
  <strong>note (for how this would work in practice)</strong>: The hash we have,
  <strong>H(X + S)</strong>, could perhaps be a string of values printed onto
  our identity card. We never have to show the cashier our birth year, only this
  hash. Being an officially-issued card, the hash here would match the hash used
  for our evidence of age, <strong>a</strong>, the government-attested piece of
  evidence.
</p>
<p>
  Several things are happening in this circuit. Firstly, the same process as the
  previous circuit is taking place. Our age is derived from the subtraction of
  <strong>X</strong> from <strong>Y</strong> and it’s compared with
  <strong>Z</strong>. If it’s <strong>≥ Z</strong>, we get our first
  <strong>T</strong>. However, <strong>X</strong> is also hashed along with a
  secret salt, <strong>S</strong>, so that we get <strong>H(X + S)</strong>,
  which is then compared with <strong>a</strong>. If the value of
  <strong>X</strong> is determined to be equal to the evidence of our age,
  <strong>a</strong>, we get another <strong>T</strong>. If we get two
  <strong>T</strong>s, it’s determined that we’re of legal age!
</p>
<p>And that’s what our circuit should roughly look like.</p>
<p>Now we can finally get to coding.</p>

<h3>Building our application — age check circuit</h3>

<p>
  You can get started with
  <a
    href="https://github.com/Zokrates/ZoKrates"
    rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >ZoKrates</a
  >
  by using the following Command Line Input for Linux, MacOS or FreeBSD:
</p>
<pre><code>curl -LSfs get.zokrat.es | sh</code></pre>
<p>
  Now that you have everything set up, we can begin by working on the simplest
  component of our ZKP circuit: the age check circuit. To refresh your memory,
  this is what it looks like:
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20ZKP%20Circuit%204.png" alt="Age check circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  Using whichever code editor you’re familiar with, create a new directory and
  make a new file called <strong>ageCheck.zok</strong>. Copy and paste the
  following into your code editor:
</p>
<pre><code>def main(private&nbsp;field&nbsp;birthYear,&nbsp;field&nbsp;comparisonYear,&nbsp;field&nbsp;minimumDifference) -&gt; (field):
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;field&nbsp;result =&nbsp;if&nbsp;comparisonYear - birthYear &gt;= minimumDifference&nbsp;then&nbsp;1&nbsp;else&nbsp;0 fi
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return&nbsp;result</code></pre>
<p>
  Let’s break this down a little. What we’re doing here is
  <strong>defining</strong> a function called <strong>main</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  All this is doing is subtracting our <strong>birth year</strong> (which you’ll
  notice is a private field) from the <strong>comparison year</strong> (our
  current year). If the result is <strong>≥ </strong>the<strong>
    minimum difference </strong
  >(21 in this case), then we get <strong>1</strong> (<strong>true</strong>). If
  not, we get a <strong>0</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Now, we need to run this circuit. Assuming you already have ZoKrates up, run
  the following CLI in your terminal:
</p>
<pre><code>zokrates compile -i ageCheck.zok</code></pre>
<p>After compiling, run the setup.</p>
<pre><code>zokrates setup</code></pre>
<p>
  You should now notice two new keys: the <strong>proving</strong> and
  <strong>verification keys</strong>. The former is used by the prover (i.e. us,
  the shopper), to generate the proof that they will share with the cashier. The
  cashier makes use of the latter key to verify this proof. Both keys are
  public—no sensitive data here.
</p>
<pre><code>zokrates compute-witness -a 1990 2020 21</code></pre>
<p>
  What we’ve just done is compute our witness. A witness is, quite simply, one
  possible solution to our circuit. You’ll notice that each value stated here
  corresponds to the fields in our code:
  <strong
    >birth year (1990), comparison year (2020), minimum difference (21)</strong
  >. If our inputs match these values, our circuit verifies this and produces a
  <strong>1</strong>.&nbsp;
</p>
<pre><code>zokrates generate-proof</code></pre>
<p>We’ve just generated our proof for this circuit.</p>
<pre><code>zokrates export-verifier</code></pre>
<p>
  Finally, our verifier. Running this should have created a verifier.sol file.
  Your screen should now (hopefully) look something like this:
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Code%20Snap.png" alt="A screenshot of the code editor">
</figure>

<p>
  That’s it for this portion of the circuit, but it might be helpful to take a
  look at how this would work in action and ensure that everything is working
  fine.
</p>
<p>
  Copy the contents of our newly made verifier.sol file and head over to
  <a href="https://remix.ethereum.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"
    >https://remix.ethereum.org/</a
  >. You’ll want to click on Solidity under Environments, as that’s what we’ll
  be using:
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Site%20Snap%201.png" alt="A screenshot of remix.etherium.org.">
</figure>

<p>
  First, you’ll want to create a new file—let’s call it AgeVerifier.sol—and
  paste the lines of code into this. Now, you’ll want find the Solidity Compiler
  icon, click it and select the AgeVerifier.sol file. Compile this with the
  appropriate compiler version (you can find the pragma of the generated .sol on
  the first line of your file).
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Site%20Snap%202.png" alt="A screenshot of solidity compiler">
</figure>

<p>
  Next, head to your Deploy and Run Transactions plugin and deploy this
  verification contract onto your browser. If you’ve done this right, you should
  now see that our verifier has boxes labelled a, b, c and Input.
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Site%20Snap%203.png" alt="A screenshot of solidity compiler's verifier boxes">
</figure>

<p>
  Heading back into your code editor and going into the proof we previously
  generated (proof.json), you’ll find each of these lines of code there. Copy
  and paste them into their respective boxes on Remix. Click on transact. You’ll
  see that our transaction has succeeded; based on the inputs, our circuit
  arrived at a <strong>T</strong> and our legal age status was verified.
</p>
<p>
  So, what just happened here? If you take a closer look at the inputs box,
  you’ll notice these last few digits:
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Site%20Snap%204.png" alt="A screenshot of age check circuit's inputs">
</figure>

<p>
  If you run them through a hexadecimal to decimal converter, you’ll realise
  that they actually correspond to 2020, 21 and 1 (this last one is just a bias
  signal that allows the circuit to run properly).
</p>
<p>
  Also, remember a, b and c? Our private input, the birth year, was also run
  through this verifier via these lines of code. You’ll not be able to work
  backwards to derive the year from them, so don’t even bother trying!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  What we just did was run all these inputs, public and private, through our
  verifier, which then checked them and ensured that our minimum age was indeed
  21.
</p>
<p>With that, we’ve finished our first circuit!</p>

<h3>Building our application — birth year check circuit</h3>

<p>
  Moving on, we’ll now try to build the next portion of our circuit, which
  verifies that the prover knows of both the secret salt and birth year inputs
  only made available to him. This establishes that the prover is indeed the
  owner of the evidence of age published by the government. This needs to exist
  because without it, our shopper could simply lie about his birth year in order
  to get the alcohol.
</p>
<p>
  Let’s create a new file and name this birthYearCheck.zok. Copy the following
  into your code editor:
</p>
<p></p>
<pre><code>import "hashes/sha256/512bitPacked" as sha256packed


  def main(private field birthYear, private field rand1, private field rand2, field hash1, field hash2) -&gt; (field):
      h = sha256packed([0, birthYear, rand1, rand2])
      h[0] == hash1
      h[1] == hash2
      return 1</code></pre>
<p>
  You may have noticed that we imported a package. This package is a hash
  function—specifically, the function SHA 256, which converts our birth year
  into a hash. You’ll actually see <strong>birth</strong>
  <strong>year</strong> listed as one of the private inputs, along with our
  <strong>secret</strong> <strong>salt</strong> (listed as
  <strong>rand1</strong> and <strong>rand2</strong>). The government-published
  <strong>evidence of age</strong>, which is also hashed, is listed here as a
  public input (<strong>hash1</strong> and <strong>hash2</strong>).
</p>
<p>
  This runs a check to verify that the values are right. If the hashes
  correspond, it returns <strong>1</strong>.
</p>
<p>We now need to run several commands as per the previous circuit.</p>
<pre><code>zokrates compile -i birthYearCheck.zok
zokrates setup
zokrates compute-witness -a 1990 123 123 233770742581153321658241226707865859106 161843013006795803511295431198461913882</code></pre>
<p>
  If you look at the values in our witness, you can see that 1990 refers to the
  birth year, while 123 123 refer to our secret salt. The last string of digits
  refers to the hash that’s published online in our national database that
  verifies the birth year we provide. This witness, like before, serves as a
  sample solution for our circuit.
</p>
<pre><code>zokrates generate-proof
zokrates export-verifier</code></pre>
<p>
  Now that this is done, we can repeat what we did for the age check circuit and
  see how this looks on Remix. You can just copy the verifier.sol that was
  generated and paste it over the existing ageverifier.sol on Remix. Repeat what
  we did before and compile this before deploying it to your browser.
</p>
<p>
  Going into proof.json, we can copy a, b, c and inputs and paste them into the
  boxes on Remix. Hit transact and it should be verified.
</p>
<p>
  As with the previous circuit, you’ll realise that our inputs actually
  correspond to our <strong>public inputs</strong>, namely the hashed
  <strong>evidence of age</strong> provided by our national database. Likewise,
  the contents of a, b and c correspond to our <strong>private inputs</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Remember that everything that we’re currently doing is on the protocol level.
  If we were building a real, user-friendly application, we would naturally need
  to abstract the process further so a user would not have to deal with any of
  this.
</p>

<h3>Building our application — the complete circuit</h3>

<p>
  Finally, let’s finish our circuit by bringing our two component circuits
  together. Again, this is what it will end up looking like:
</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20ZKP%20Circuit%205.png" alt="Full ZKP circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  Let’s make a new file in our code editor and call this complete.zok. Copy the
  following into your editor:
</p>
<pre><code>import "hashes/sha256/512bitPacked" as sha256packed


  def birthYearCheck(private field birthYear, private field rand1, private field rand2, field hash1, field hash2) -&gt; (field):
      h = sha256packed([0, birthYear, rand1, rand2])
      h[0] == hash1
      h[1] == hash2
      return 1

  def ageCheck(private field birthYear, field comparisonYear, field minimumDifference) -&gt; (field):
      field result = if comparisonYear - birthYear &gt;= minimumDifference then 1 else 0 fi
      return result

  def main(private field birthYear, private field rand1, private field rand2, field hash1, field hash2, field comparisonYear, field minimumDifference) -&gt; (field):
      birthYearTest = birthYearCheck(birthYear, rand1, rand2, hash1, hash2)
      birthYearTest == 1
      ageTest = ageCheck(birthYear, comparisonYear, minimumDifference)
      ageTest == 1
      return 1</code></pre>
<p>
  As you can see, we’ve incorporated our birthyear and age checks into the code.
  The first two portions are exactly the same as the previous two circuits we’ve
  worked on. Finally, at the bottom, if both of the previous functions are true,
  our circuit returns a 1, or true.
</p>
<p>Now, let’s run our commands:</p>
<pre><code>zokrates compile -i complete.zok
zokrates setup
zokrates compute-witness -a 1990 123 123 233770742581153321658241226707865859106 161843013006795803511295431198461913882 2020 21</code></pre>
<p>
  Again, let’s look through our values. We have, in order, our
  <strong>birth year</strong>, our <strong>secret salt</strong>, our
  government-provided hash (or <strong>evidence of age</strong>), the
  <strong>current year</strong>, and finally our legal age (or
  <strong>minimum difference)</strong>. These are all the inputs we need for
  this circuit. Finally:
</p>
<pre><code>zokrates generate-proof
zokrates export-verifier</code></pre>
<p>
  We can finally take a look at how this will work back on Remix. Head back
  over, copy and paste the contents of your verifier.sol into your browser and
  compile it. Deploy this into your browser as usual, and then copy and paste a,
  b, c and your inputs from your proof.json file into the boxes under your
  Deployed Contracts.
</p>
<p>If you’d like, you can take a closer look at our inputs on Remix:</p>

<figure style="text-align: center">
	  <img src="/assets/img/2%20Site%20Snap%205.png" alt="A screenshot of the inputs for the full ZKP circuit">
</figure>

<p>
  Again, each line can be run through a hexadecimal to decimal converter if you
  want to find out what they correspond to. The first two lines are the hash
  provided by the government, while the subsequent lines refer to the same
  public inputs as before: 2020, 21 and 1, our bias signal.
</p>
<p>
  In any case, if everything has been done correctly to this point, our circuit
  should have been verified…
</p>
<p>
  …and that’s it! You can pat yourself on the back because you’ve successfully
  created a legal age ZKP circuit.
