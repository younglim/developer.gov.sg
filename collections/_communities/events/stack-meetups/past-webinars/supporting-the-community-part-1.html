    <h2>STACK-X Webinar – Tech for Public Good: Supporting the Community (Part 1)</h2>
    <p>
        <em>The following article was adapted from a STACK-X Webinar conducted by
            Patricia Zhao, Lead UX Designer, GovTech.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>This first part of a two-part series focuses on the development journey of
            SupplyAlly.</em>
    </p>
    <h3>How SupplyAlly was born</h3>
    <p>
        SupplyAlly, or Sally for short, is a <a href="https://www.supplyally.gov.sg/"
            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">mobile app</a> that facilitates the process
        of logistics distribution, especially in times of need during COVID-19 and the
        post-COVID era. While STACK-X Meetup participants might know of it, and even
        make use of Sally in their own distribution campaigns, not many know of the
        circumstances behind Sally’s development.
    </p>
    <p>It started with a phone call on April 1st.</p>
    <p>
        Steven Koh, Director of Government Digital Services at GovTech, received a
        call from the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the People’s
        Association (PA). They wanted to know if GovTech could develop an app that
        would digitalise the nationwide reusable mask distribution exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        When was the distribution exercise going to start? <em>April 5th, </em>came
        the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the span of four days, our engineers repurposed and refined an existing
        application into SupplyAlly, a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for mask
        distribution. When we were notified of this request, we only knew that
        SupplyAlly was meant for a nationwide distribution campaign, and that masks
        were to be issued. With just this information, we had to develop an app that
        was designed with a low barrier to entry for users without much tech knowledge
        and training. As we did not know how many people were involved in distributing
        masks, we had to develop a form of authorisation and authentication that was
        scalable with the size of the volunteer efforts. A core feature of Sally was
        to allow campaign operators to learn how to use the app with basic guidance;
        for collection, Sally had to recognise identifiers such as the barcodes on
        individuals’ physical NRIC in case they lacked digital forms of
        identities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Given the time constraints, speed was a major consideration – what are the
        essential steps for using this app, and what is the most basic way of
        verifying identities? These were key concerns for the team as we worked round
        the clock to meet the deadline.
    </p>
    <h3>A helping hand for the community</h3>
    <p>
        Once we set Sally up, it helped MTI and the PA to distribute reusable masks
        across Singapore through the various Community Centres. To date, 4.2 million
        masks have been issued through this campaign.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Moving ahead, we also saw great potential for Sally to support charitable
        efforts in Singapore. During the Circuit Breaker period, home-based learning
        was implemented but some children could not participate as they lacked access
        to internet laptops. That’s why we decided to partner Engineering Good to
        distribute refurbished laptops to underprivileged students for home-based
        learning.
    </p>
    <p>
        From June onwards, we worked with the Community Development Council (CDC) and
        PA to distribute voucher booklets to families in need. Currently, our partners
        have used Sally to distribute vouchers to more than 250,000 households out of
        400,000 eligible households. Sally also directly contributes to the national
        contact tracing effort against COVID-19. In partnership with our parent
        organisation, the Smart Nation and Digital Government Group (SNDGG) and the
        Agency for Integrated Care’s (AIC)’s Silver Generation Office, more than
        10,000 TraceTogether Tokens were issued to the elderly who do not own
        smartphones and other digitally-excluded members of the population. Most
        recently, we engaged Food from the Heart, a charitable organisation, to give
        out hot meals to the elderly and other service users around the Mountbatten
        area. Sally vastly simplified the process of tracking and recording items
        distributed, ensuring equitable distribution of essentials for individuals and
        households.
    </p>
    <h3>SupplyAlly and Cloud</h3>
    <p>
        The campaigns that we’ve supported since May are actively running and
        supporting the community. Yet, when you visit Google Play or the iOS App
        Store, you don’t see multiple versions of Sally for each individual campaign.
        How do we support multiple distribution campaigns within a single app?
    </p>
    <p>
        The answer lies with the use of Cloud technologies that allow Sally to run
        multiple development campaigns concurrently. Individuals can then access their
        specific campaigns by logging in with a unique QR code provided for them.
    </p>
    <p>
        The cost of using public Cloud services was a consideration from the start of
        Sally’s development. Since campaigns run for an extended period of time, we
        needed to calculate and determine how much memory was used against the costs
        charged by the provider. Using serverless solutions (where one only pays for
        the computing power they use) also helped us scale rapidly when needed, since
        we saved costs by consuming less resources when certain campaigns were not
        activated.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>Is it safe to use public cloud services, considering the government’s need
            for security?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        On our <a href="/products/categories/infrastructure-and-hosting/government-on-commercial-cloud"
            rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Government Commercial Cloud (GCC)</a>, we follow leading data management
        practices and further protect data by using secure services. Sally also does
        not store any personal identifiable information such as service users’ NRIC
        information. Instead, the app merely takes a fingerprint of the information in
        accordance with data management guidelines.
    </p>
    <h3>Developing one app for multiple partners</h3>
    <p>
        The next question that arose during Sally’s development was: can we cater for
        our partners’ varying needs and wants, even as their campaigns are running
        under one app?
    </p>
    <p>
        Recognising that both present and future partners are going to differ on this
        aspect, our team stayed true to our DNA and focused on establishing consistent
        fundamentals.
    </p>
    <p>
        <img src="/assets/img/SupplyAlly DNA slide.png" />
    </p>
    <p>Three things remain the same throughout all the distribution campaigns:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                Our partner organisations or agencies will tell us how to identify
                legitimate beneficiaries and Sally will use the criteria accordingly. NRIC
                scanning is enabled, as is QR code scanning, which Food from the Heart
                uses.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Service users’ collections are recorded within a given time period. For
                example, if an individual is eligible for one ice cream weekly, the
                collection count for this person will be reset every week. Depending on
                the campaign’s requirements, the time period can be adjusted accordingly –
                some use cases include determining how long an individual is assigned an
                item or how many times an item can be distributed to the individual.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                The operator of the app is also notified on individuals’ eligibility and
                past transactions.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>The customer journey for different stakeholders</h3>
    <p>
        <em>As a service user, I know that the Government is giving me some resources
            that I’m entitled to. What do I do next?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        You only need to bring your means of identification as specified by the
        distribution campaign. For some partner agencies, it could be your NRIC, or
        even a QR code (as with Food from the Heart’s campaign).
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>I’m a distribution agent. What is the process like when using Sally?</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Firstly, you need to scan the barcode on the physical NRIC of the service
        user. If the person is eligible to collect, the next screen will display the
        assigned quota and inform you that Sally will be capturing the details of the
        item being given out. When you proceed, the item will be redeemed, recorded
        and tracked within the system.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the entitlement is exceeded, there will be an error notification that
        indicates when the person last collected the item.
    </p>
    <h3>What’s next for Sally, and what have we learnt throughout the
        journey?
    </h3>
    <p>
        When we reach out to our many partners of varying digital literacy levels, we
        seek to learn about their experiences with Sally. Has it been working for
        them? How difficult is it to use?
    </p>
    <p>
        From our development journey and the feedback we’ve received, we’ve identified
        some new features that Sally can benefit from.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Empowering users to allow appeals when individuals’ entitlement limits
                    are reached. </strong>We want to give campaign distributors the option to allow individuals to
                collect again, and have these extra collections tracked in the
                system. We’re also pleased to announce that this feature has been
                developed and tested – it will be ready for release in September.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Some of the error messages and feedback displayed to app users are not
                    intuitive.</strong> Since the messages are more technically-driven than user-driven, they can
                be a little hard to understand sometimes. That’s why we revamped these
                messages to help users overcome simple issues while using Sally. These
                changes will also be released in September.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Improving the login process for Sally.</strong> The login code is
                key for allowing people to log into various environments so that multiple
                campaigns can be run concurrently. But the code can be lost, and the
                administrative side of the campaign has the heavy responsibility of
                managing thousands of QR login codes for the distributors. That’s why
                we’re exploring ways to improve this login process through rethinking and
                redesigning the status quo.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Displaying statistics on the app. </strong>Users from PA and other
                partner organisations have asked us about this option, and it’s something
                we’re looking into implementing down the road.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <p>
                <strong>Including non-English users of Sally. </strong>Another
                consideration that the team is working toward is the inclusion of Chinese
                translations to Sally, for a start. We believe that this would aid users
                even more, increasing Sally’s user-friendliness.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Developing Sally feels like rock climbing. There’s always one more step to
        take, and sometimes it gets really difficult depending on the terrain you’re
        on. While passion has led us here, there’s still much more work ahead. But
        more work also means more opportunities, and it’s a sign that the team needs
        to work harder to take advantage of them.
