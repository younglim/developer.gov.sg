<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Healthcare claims can be complex to analyse holistically with hundreds of different data fields and multiple backend systems used by medical providers in Singapore.
</p>
<p>
  The National Platform for Healthcare Claims (NPHC) team in GovTech’s Government Digital Services (GDS) division is developing a solution that generates results comparable to the healthcare data systems being replaced. The team then took this a step further with the Automated Test Data Generator that produces fast and accurate results.
</p>
<p>
  The team will deep dive into how NPHC’s Automated Test Data Generator allows product owners and Quality Engineers to define and expand test scenarios easily. This module helps automates labor-intensive test logic like test patients and payers’ account creation, utilisation set-up, and most importantly, claim submission. With the generator, Quality Engineers can create tests on the medical schemes without the hassle of test data creation. Test data and permuted scenarios are also created without the need to manually create test data on the testing against the as-is system.
</p>
<p>
  The floor will also be opened to attendees during this session. The NPHC team will be taking questions from anyone involved in automated testing and welcoming sharing of your experiences with this process as well. <a href="https://form.gov.sg/#!/62c667aca8e24700125d63b8" target="_blank"><strong>Sign up</strong></a> now!
</p>
<p>
  Who should attend: SWEs, System Engineers, Delivery and Product Managers, and Techies involved in automated testing and related business functions.
