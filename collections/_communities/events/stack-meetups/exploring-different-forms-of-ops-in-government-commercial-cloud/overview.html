<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  GovTech has been migrating an increasing number of projects to the Cloud. Operating and managing an environment
  consisting of multiple Clouds and services pose numerous challenges.
</p>
<p>
  There is also a need to transform operations into 'x'Ops in order to support multiple projects within the GCC.
</p>
<p>
  Join us at this Meetup to gain insights on GovTech's Cloud transformation.
