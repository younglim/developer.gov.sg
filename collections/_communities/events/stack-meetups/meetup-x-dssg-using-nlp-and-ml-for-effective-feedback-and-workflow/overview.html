<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Who should attend: If you're a techie with beginner to intermediate data science knowledge and basic understanding of Natural Language Processing, this Meetup is for you!
</p>
<p>
  Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of Artificial Intelligence that gives machines the ability to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.
</p>
<p>
  Join our speakers from the Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) in GovTech to learn how NLP and Deep Learning work to automatically analyse municipal issues feedback. Discover how a small team quickly prototyped an NLP workflow to understand business concerns too.
</p>
