<!-- Event details -->
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
  Experts from GovTech’s Data Science & Artificial Intelligence Division (DSAID) and Amazon Web Services (AWS)'s Machine Learning Solutions Lab (MLSL) will highlight how the Whole-of-Government Video Analytics System (VAS) transformed real-world operations at agencies such as NEA and NParks.
</p>
<p>
  VAS is a centralised and scalable AI-powered platform enabling the rapid development and deployment of video analytics solutions, exchange of video data and analytics across agencies, and expansion of the video sensor data and insights network.
</p>
<p>
  The collaboration with AWS Sagemaker for VAS’ model training and inference architecture enables VAS to reliably scale the platform to meet users’ needs. Image Quality Assessment (IQA) also provides a crucial measure to evaluate the performance of image processing algorithms used in platforms like VAS
</p>
<p>
  Who should attend: Industry stakeholders interested in computer vision and deep learning-based IQA models, as well as public agencies keen to onboard Video Analytics System (VAS); Levelling: Beginner.
